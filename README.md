# Diversity-test-suite-reduction
Evaluating String Distance Metrics for Reduction of Automatically Generated Test Suites.

## Replication package
This reporsitory contains the replication package for the paper entitled `Evaluating String Distance Metrics for Reduction of Automatically Generated Test Suites`.
All resources and source codes are available here.

## Contents
The code folder contains the project with a README file to explain the basic instructions to run the tool.

The data folder contains all the data of the study. 
1. The "original-test-suites" folder contains all the original test suites used for the reduction.
2. The "reduced-data" folder contains the reduced test suites using all similarity metrics and different sizes.
3. The "repeated-test-suites" folder contains all the different original test suites used to verify the results.

Finally, the pdf file contains all the analysis tables and figures from our experiments.
